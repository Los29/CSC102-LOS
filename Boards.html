<h1>
    THIS IS MY PROGRAM OF STUDY AT UAT
</h1>
<h3>
    I choose this program because since I have always loved art and creating. 
    This degree will allow my to continue my passion while allowing me to remain in the manufacturing sector,
    after I complete my bachelors I will focus on getting into aerospace or biomedical.

    DIGITAL MAKER AND FABRICATION
</h1>
<h3> <!--this portion is copied from the course catalog-->
   <p id="paragraph 1"> Startup organizations, inventors and innovators rely on Agile approaches to prototype, evaluate and bring creations to market
    by way of digital fabrication tools. The Digital Maker and Fabrication (DMF) degree prepares graduates to design and build
    new technology devices by combining design theory, programming, materials, human factors and prototyping with 3D printing
    and other maker technologies. Students in this degree will practice taking design concepts and then modeling, designing and
    building these objects using 3D design software and rapid prototyping tools. DMF students will learn to inform their designs
    based on choosing the best materials for each design element. Students will learn how to program the embedded systems
    driving their devices, using tools such as C++ and Arduino, in ways that support creating smart and internet-enabled devices.
    Students will learn fundamental tools found in makerspaces that allow for rapid prototyping. These include 3D printers, laser
    cutters, CNC fabric cutters and rapid forming tools. Framing their design and engineering prototype knowledge, DMF students
    are exposed to how rapid development works within Agile and MVP iterative development cycles. The Classification of
    Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Digital Maker and Fabrication is 50.0404.

    DIGITAL MAKER AND FABRICATION DEGREE OBJECTIVES
</h1>
<h3> <!--this portion is copied from the course catalog-->
    <p id="paragraph 2">1. Using digital and physical tools, engineer and build prototypes that technology patents are then applied for.<br>
    2. Build physical products while demonstrating technique and safety competency across commonly accepted prototyping
       devices, maker tools and techniques.<br>
    3. Produce products that balance form and function while reflecting current and future trends in design and human factors.<br>
    4. Demonstrate the ability to evaluate material and build technique options during the creation of products and their
    prototypes.<br>
    5. Demonstrate the ability to effectively implement embedded systems and fundamental electronics into product builds.<br>
    6. Place prototypes and builds within the Agile and MVP development frameworks.<br>
